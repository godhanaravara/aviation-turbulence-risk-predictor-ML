    "Principal Component Analysis helped in several ways:\n",
    "- Dimensionality Reduction: Reduced feature set from 15+ to just a handful of uncorrelated components without losing critical variance.\n",
    "- Noise Filtering: Suppressed redundant weather features, keeping only those most useful for distinguishing turbulence patterns.\n",
    "- Interpretability: Enabled visual analysis of turbulent vs. non-turbulent samples, showing that turbulence forms unique clusters in transformed space.\n",
    "- Downstream Clustering: The transformed PCA data was used for K-Means clustering to assign unsupervised high-risk labels, which are important for detecting turbulence regimes even when labeled data is scarce."
