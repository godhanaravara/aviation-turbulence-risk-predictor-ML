## â–¸ Problem Statement

Turbulence, especially clear-air turbulence (CAT), remains a serious challenge for aviation safety, often arising unexpectedly and outside the reach of radar-based forecasting systems. This project aims to **predict high-risk turbulence events** using open datasets from aviation reports and atmospheric reanalysis sources, thereby providing a data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based forecasting methods.

The work draws inspiration from the approach introduced by [Mizuno et al. (2022)](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-022-00584-5), who demonstrated the potential of [machine learning based turbulence risk prediction](https://github.com/smzn/Turbulence) near Japanese airports. Their open-source implementation helped guide early exploration, though this project significantly extends the scope by applying the methodology at a national scale using U.S. PIREPs and ERA5 data.

## [Data Sources & Collection](https://github.com/godhanaravara/aviation-turbulence-risk-predictor-ML/blob/main/01-Data-collection/01-data-sources-and-acquisition.ipynb)

- **PIREPs** (Pilot Reports)
  From the Iowa Environmental Mesonet to real-time turbulence observations from pilots.

- **ERA5 Reanalysis**  
  Hourly pressure-level atmospheric data (28 levels) from Copernicus CDS, with over 1.5 TB downloaded for 2024.  
  Variables included: wind speed, shear, cloud content, vorticity, geopotential, humidity, and more.

- [**Class Balancing**](https://github.com/godhanaravara/aviation-turbulence-risk-predictor-ML/blob/main/03-Class-balancing/04-class-balancing.ipynb)
  - â¤· Isolation Forest: Downsampled the majority "NEG" turbulence class based on anomaly scores  
  -  â¤· SMOTE: Oversampled the critical "SEVâ€“EXTRM" turbulence cases
