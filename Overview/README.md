    "# üìò Machine Learning for Turbulence Risk Prediction in U.S. Airspace\n",

    "## ‚úàÔ∏è Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Turbulence, especially clear-air turbulence (CAT), remains a serious challenge for aviation safety ‚Äî often arising unexpectedly and outside the reach of radar-based forecasting systems. This project aims to **predict high-risk turbulence events** using open datasets from aviation reports and atmospheric reanalysis sources, providing a data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
